**\#104 Maximum Depth of Binary Tree**  
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/  
Detail:  
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.  

**\#126 Word Ladder II**  
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/  
Detail:
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list,  
find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:  

Only one letter can be changed at a time  
Each intermediate word must exist in the word list  

For example  
Given:  
beginWord = "hit" endWord = "cog" wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]  
Return  
  [  
    ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],  
    ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]  
  ]  

Note:  
All words have the same length.  
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.  

**#258 Add Digits#**  
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/  
Detail:  
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.  

For example:  
Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.  

**#292 Nim Game#**  
LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/  
Detail:  
You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:  
There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones.  
The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.  
Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game.  
Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.  

For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game:  
no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
